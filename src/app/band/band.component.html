                <p> Born in the very west of Austria, where the world is nothing more but a cracked fa√ßade of a
                Shire-like and sheltered existence - Gallowhead and their music try to peak through the cracks
                and shine a light on the other side of the same dirty coin.<br>
                Growling bass tones reverberate angrily and snug tightly around groovy drum rhythms which
                creates a rigid surface, only to be cut through by a pair of distorted guitars on the brink of
                complete failure.<br>
                The songs get accompanied by the occasional dreamy melody only to be
                sucked back into the swamp of nothingness by shouts and growls of unforgiveness.<br>
                The lyrics, just like the music, revolve around the irony of life, bodily fluids, pain and its
                acceptance.
